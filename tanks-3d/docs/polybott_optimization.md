# PolyBott Optimization Tracker

**Purpose**: Track learnings and optimizations for the PolyBott 3D asset management sub-agent

**Agent Role**: PolyBott is a specialized Claude Code agent that understands Kenney.nl 3D assets and builds game environments by intelligently placing and combining models.

## Version History

### v0.1 - Initial Setup (2025-10-28)
- Created initial tracking document
- Defined agent purpose and scope

---

## Known Asset Types

### Complete Models
- Full objects that don't require assembly
- Examples: TBD after asset inventory

### Component Assets  
- Parts that need to be combined to create structures
- Examples: TBD after asset inventory

---

## Optimizations Needed

### Asset Understanding
- [ ] Create asset inventory system
- [ ] Categorize assets (complete vs. components)
- [ ] Document asset dimensions and pivot points
- [ ] Create assembly rules for component assets

### Placement Intelligence
- [ ] Develop positioning strategies
- [ ] Implement snapping/alignment logic
- [ ] Handle rotation and scaling appropriately
- [ ] Collision detection awareness

### Workflow Efficiency
- [ ] Template patterns for common structures
- [ ] Batch operations for repetitive tasks
- [ ] Scene organization best practices

## Learnings Log

### Session 1: Setup Phase
- Starting fresh with no asset knowledge
- Need to establish baseline inventory first

## Prompt Patterns That Work

*To be populated as we learn what prompts are most effective*

---

## Prompt Patterns That Don't Work

*To be populated as we identify ineffective approaches*

---

## Future Enhancements

- AI-driven procedural generation using available assets
- Asset combination suggestions
- Material/texture management
- Lighting recommendations based on asset types
